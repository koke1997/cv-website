## About Me

Backend Developer at **RISE** (Research Industrial Systems Engineering) in Leipzig, working on infrastructure management, IAM systems, and backend development. I use Terragrunt, Java, Terraform, and Docker daily.

Before RISE, I spent over 4 years at **IDnow** in Munich and Leipzig, progressing from Ident Specialist through Fraud Prevention to Technical Services Engineer. I handled L3 support, built OCR engines, wrote Lambda functions, and worked with monitoring tools like Graylog and Grafana.

I also founded **In Voice d.o.o.** in Bosnia and Herzegovina - an IT consulting company where I built CRM systems, developed OCR solutions using Beowulf clusters, and worked on VoIP infrastructure.

Currently finishing my Information Technology degree at University of Mostar, focusing on databases and data science.
